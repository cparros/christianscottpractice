  <h2>Review: My Quick Thoughts on Christian Scott</h2>
  <div class="main">
    <p>I stumbled onto Christian Scott back in 2006 when I heard his first album "Rewind That". I was a young drummer in
      the music section in Barnes and Nobles looking for new music to play to, and was a big fan of a drummer named
      Thomas
      Pridgen who happened to be the drummer for Christian's first album. Once I heard the first song I was hooked and
      couldn't stop listening to it. I had the Album on repeat. Since then I have been a non stop listener. In recent
      years he has added to his name. He is also now known as "aTunde Adjuah", to honor his West African self identity.
      He
      has also been heavily influenced by african rhythm and encorperated it into his recent projects which has made for
      very different yet captivating music. I am always excited to hear what he creates and cannot wait for his next
      album. If you are looking for new music in a world where many of the mainstream artists can sound the same I
      <strong>highly</strong> recommend giving Christian Scott a listen!</p>
    <p class="center">His newest album is called "Axiom" and can be streamed on most music streaming platforms.</p>
